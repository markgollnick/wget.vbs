wget.vbs
========

An HTTP file downloader (inspired by GNU [wget][]) written in VBScript.

[wget]: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm


Rationale
---------

Ever needed to do some automated post-install and set-up on a brand-spankin'
new installation of Windows? Or, ever wished you could download stuff onto said
brand-new Windows box from the comfort and convenience of a batch script?
Yeah...

Hence wget.vbs, which is runnable on out-of-the-box set-ups. (It's in VBScript
instead of PowerShell because it was written in a day and an age when I was
still using Windows XP, but it will also work for Vista+)

You could even use VBS wget to get GNU [wget][]...

Use it wisely!


Requirements
------------

* cscript.exe (CLI)
* wscript.exe (GUI; default for double-click of VBS file)

...Both of which come with Windows, so nothing is really required (aside from
Windows itself) for wget.vbs to run. :-)


Usage
-----

CLI Execution:

    cscript wget.vbs <url> [save_to_file]

GUI Execution:

    wscript wget.vbs <url> [save_to_file]
